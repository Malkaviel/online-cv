    summary: |
      I am a french student programmer.

      I studied at the Puy-En-Velay's University, an institute specialized in graphics programming. I learnt about OpenGL, the Unity game engine, the maths behind 3D software, C++ and C#.

      During internships, I worked as a web developer on various e-commerce websites and web applications. I learnt about web framework architecture and web frameworks like Symfony and Thelia.

      I am currently studying:
      - The development of real-time 3D applications at the Puy-en-Velay's IUT.
      - The development of web applications (back-end), thanks to an apprenticeship contract at OpenStudio.
      - The design and implementation of programming languages and game engines, on my spare time.

        My job is to implement new functionalities, correct bugs and refactor the codebase of the tools used by the websites
        built by OpenStudio.

        I am also responsible for the improvement of the working process, by automating the tests and deployments

        I worked as a back-end web developer at FB Digital, a web agency in Brioude, France.

        My job, at first, was to assist the lead developer with small tasks, in order to gain experience
        with the tools used by the company (PHP, Symfony web framework, Thelia e-commerce framework).

        Later, during the last months of internship and after getting acquainted with the tools and the development processes,
        i was able to be the main developer of an e-commerce website, implementing most back-end functionalities.
